			<h2 class="process-title">Inspiration</h2>
			<p class="small-exp">
				In a discussion with a friend, I generated this idea as a new way to interact with ecommerce websites. In short, the idea is an interactable fashion lookup where a user can hover over an article of clothing and see it appear on the side. 
			</p>
			<p class="small-exp">
				When I attempted to communicate the idea, I became unsure of how effective the interaction might be. It seemed like a good idea in my head but without actually doing it I was unsure how intuitive and effective it would be. 
			</p>
			<p class="small-exp">
				I decided to rapid prototype the idea to quickly get an understanding of the idea.
			</p>
			<h2 class="process-title">Design Ideation</h2>
			<p class="small-exp">
				The process began by creating quick sketch wireframes. I labeled how the page would work together and identified the minimum components the prototype would need to communicate the design idea.
			</p>
				<img src="img/lookbk/quick_sketches.jpg" class='process-img'>

			<h2 class="process-title">Proof of Concept</h2>
			<p class="small-exp">
				I selected a single "wardrobe" page and a "quick view" component to prototype using the following tools:
				 <ul class="small-ul">
					 <li>SVG code generated in Adobe Illustrator</li>
					 <li>D3.js, data visualization library</li>
					 <li>jQuery, javascript library</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="small-exp">
				Using Adobe Illustrator, I outlined articles of clothes and than exported the file to SVG code.
			</p>
			<img src="img/lookbk/svg_overlay.png" class="process-img">
			
			<p class="small-exp">
				Inserting the SVG code generated in Illustrator, I used D3.js to add event handling and styling to the svg objects. 
			</p>
			<p class="small-exp">
				Next, I progmatically generated the "Quick View Box" using jQuery.
			</p>

			<p class="desktop">
				The overall goal of the prototype was to get a quick idea of how interaction might work. View it below.
			</p>
			<p class="mobile"> To use the prototype please visit this page on a desktop. The prototype was meant for a desktop experience. but as you will see below a mobile mockup with a similar type of interaction was mockedup as well.</p>

			<h2 class="process-title">Evaluation</h2>
			<p class="small-exp">
				I tested it with a few test users and the result were promising! I found users felt familiar with the prototype and even found a few users were able to identify the need of such a UI within fashon lookbooks.
			</p>
			<h2 class="process-title">Design Iteration</h2>
			<p class="small-exp">
				With the feedback gathered in the test, I used Adobe XD to rapidly iterate designs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I next created a series of wireframes and high fidelity mockups to further articulate my design idea.

			<h2 class="process-title">Development</h2>
			<p class="small-exp">
				My plan is to develop a final proof of concept using React and D3. To do this the prototype will be composed of the following components, interactions, and animations.
