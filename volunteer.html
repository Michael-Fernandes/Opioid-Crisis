	<figcaption> The 2017 Neah Bay Alternative Spring Break Team, on our first ever meeting!</figcaption>
	<p class="process-exp">
		I try to be an active advocate for inclusion in tech. To do this I have taught classes, mentored younger students, and done outreach with the Human Centered Design and Engineering department. My trip to Neah Bay in the spring 2017 was one of my proudest moments in this work and something that I hope all people passionate about diversity in the high tech community could experience :)

	<p class="process-exp">
		A typical spring break involves a plane ticket to mexico and and all inclusive hotel. My final spring break in college was quite the opposite but much more memorable.
	</p>
	<p class="process-exp">
		UW pipeline gives disadvantaged k12 students whom normally wouldn't be thinking about higher education a helping hand to geting into UW. The alternative spring break program in particular sends groups of University of Washington students into disadvantaged communites to teach classes for a week. 
	</p>


	<p class="process-exp">
		During the winter and spring of 2017, along with a group of 6 other students we built an alternative spring break program to teach design thinking to middle school students. During a stormy late april week we went to Neah Bay Washington at, the most northern point in continental United States, to teach the workshops to 100+ 6-8th grade students.
	</p>

	<p class="process-exp">
		The experience was unbeatable. A two for one combining a uniquely entertaining week with friends and prodoundly rewarding volunteer experience. It was like a two for one spring break.
