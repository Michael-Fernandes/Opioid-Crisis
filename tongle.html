						Sustainability and increased fuel efficiency have caused the conventional way to fund road improvement(a tax on gasoline) to become ineffective at funding infrastructure improvement. A Road Usage Charge, by multiple states, that suggests a road usage charge on cars in proportion to how much it uses public roads. 	I lead a <b>Participatory Design</b> effort to design a mobile app solution for a road usage charge. Using insights and preliminary designs made in participatory design workshops, my team and I designed Tongle, a smart government technology that allows drivers to track their road usage on a per mile basis in order to contribute to a Road Usage Charge.

					Problem and Background
				</h1>
				<p class="process-exp">
					Currently, most states use a tax on gas revenues to pay for road infrastructure projects. Rapid growth of fuel efficent and electric vehicles has made gasoline taxes increasingly inefficent. To solve the funding gap, a road usage charge has been suggested in states such as New York, California, Oregon and Washington. In a road usage charge, drivers pay a "mileage tax" in proportion to how much they use public roads. 
				</p>

				<p class="process-exp" >
					In the winter of 2017, a representitive from The Washington State Transportation Comission approached my team and I with the opprotunity to design a mobile phone solution for a road usage charge. The representive wanted above all a human-centered approach to innovation and gave us full funding to deliver such a solution.

					Why This Project Scared My Team.
				</h1>
				<p class="process-exp">
					As a human-centered designer, my team and I were concerned with the impact that a road usage tracking technology would have on end-users. Accurately monitoring road usage and accounting for things like out of state travel, private roads, and non-taxable trips might hurt the autonomy of end-users. A mobile phone road usage system affects <b>privacy</b>(to collect accurate data), <b>inconveniences</b> users, and raises <b>fairness</b> issues. Even before starting, my team and I new that navigating the complex interaction between values was key to the sucess of this project.

					Choosing Participatory Design
				</h1>
				<img class="process-img" src="img/tongle/pd.png" alt="http://dlrtoolkit.com/participatory-design/">
				<p class="process-exp">
					Participatory Design(PD) is a fundamentally democratic process. PD aims to increase the agency of the eventual end-users. Shifting the focal point of design to center around those being designed for, results in a product which better serves those using it.
				</p>

				<p class="process-exp">
					We chooose to accept a definition of participatory design which says: <b>a participatory result is one that increases the agency of the end-users of the product</b>[<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2940316" class="text-link">Tonne Brattetieg</a>].

					<i>Design your own tax.</i>
				</div>
				<p class="proces-exp">
					I choose to theme our participatory design process around the tag line "design your own tax". I imagined a process that allowed participants to set up a road usage charge that fit their needs. With my tean, we planned to use an <b>agile methodolgy</b> which deployed alternating sprints of research and design. The cycle would begin with a week in which we focus on research followed by a week where we applied the research. As the project progressed I ended up drawing heavily from the <a class="text-link" href="http://www.vsdesign.org/publications/pdf/non-scan-vsd-and-information-systems.pdf"> Value Sensitive Design</a> as a way <b>to navigate the complex human values</b> that exist in this design problem.

					Participatory Workshop
				</h1>
				<p class="proces-exp">
					To inform the development of our product, my team and I planned 3 participatory design workshops. During theese workshops we invited the same group of 9 people to share their values, insights and design ideas. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Together, in each workshop my team led the invited members through a series of acitivites. These acitivites included a wide range of design acitivites ranging from infinity diagraming to mini-design sprints. During, workshops resembled <b>a mix of ethnographic user research and co-design acitivities</b>. For example, in conversation with participants, informals interview skills were used to elicit unbiased data. On the other hand, co-design acitivites allowed users to communicate ideas through design artifacts without our intentionality biasing their products.

				<p class="process-exp">
					To keep a pariticpatory process, to decide what insights to focus on, my team and I <a class="text-link" href="https://goo.gl/forms/C9gxxjz0G0d2veHJ2">shared</a>  our findings  with participants while at the same time allowing them to rank which ones they thought were the most important to the road usage charge. By allowing pariticpants to rank values we further allowed end-users themeselves to approve which values should be embded in our product.

					An interesting thing happened when we showed participants the values they ranked as important to a road usage charge. People slected the values using them in groups of two or more to create "value tensions". Tensions empowered participants to <b>evaluate the strengths and weakness of an idea based off values that mattered to them</b>.

					After collecting feedback, we said good bye to a group people we had grown definite bonds with over the past 6 weeks. We were all, a bit suprisingly, sad to say goodbye to a group of 9 strangers we had met just 6 weeks ago but excited for what came next. 
				</p>

				<p class="process-exp">
					Our participatory design group gave the most promising feedback to <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/58fbb314-923f-4480-b595-e5736868f9c9/" class="text-link">Prototype 3: Toggle Dongle + Dual Solution</a>. In this prototype, participants used an external device to track miles locally accessing those miles through a phone. We found that participants like that not having to have their phone with them all the time gave them flexbility to have both an accurate an convenient system. We took the inspiration from the idea of having the ability to toggle on/off between two values and named our product Tongle.

					Some Thoughts on PD
				</h1>

				<div class="process-exp">
					Sucessfully completing a PD project without having prior experience with the design style pushed my skills as a user-centered designer. From the experience I learned that a PD project needs a extra time and preperation to complete. Since each project requires active particpation from participants it may be necessary to design unique workshops and design sessions depending on the current state of the problem. Throughout this write-up I tried to incoperate some benefits I found in the PD process as I came by them in the process. The value is so much more than popular tag lines that are tossed around along with the buzzword Particpatory Design. You really need to be involved in a PD project to understand. Overall, my biggest recommendation to those who want to use the design process is to take on the following definition.
