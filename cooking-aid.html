				<div class="overview">
					CookingAid provides a mobile and wearable application which supports people before, during, and after the act of cooking. Using a user-centered design process driven by ethonographic research I previously conducted, I designed a complete mobile app experience. Using Cooking Aid home cooks can find and review recipes, prepare a shopping list, and most importantly recieve assistance while cooking a recipe.

				<h1 class="overview-title">Background and Problem</h1>
				<div class="overview">
					To create CookingAid using ethanographic research collected for a class. Originally, I never intended to use the ethnographic researchs findings I collected for the class for anything other than an exercise in qualitative research methods. However, becoming deeply involved with home cooks as they engaged in the cooking process gave an understanding of the pain points they faced when engaging in the activity of cooking. After growing an understanding of the problems that home cooks faced (and being one myself) I felt motivated to take action. Becoming deeply involved with home cooks as they engaged in the cooking process gave an understanding of the pain points they faced when engaging in the activity of cooking.

				<div class="process-exp">
					My intial research included, <b>contextual inquiries and semi-structured interviews</b>. During which transcriptions of the dialogue and observations were made. From the data set, several iterations of of "qualitative coding" were done to find common themes within the data set.

				<h1 class="process-title">Taking Action</h1>
				<p class="process-exp">
					Having the knowledge of pain points cooks faced during the cooking process necessitated me to create a solution. Even for something as harmless as cooking, knowing the pain points and not doing anything almost seemed unethical to me.
				</p>

				<div class='process-exp'>
					A technical solution seemed appropriate here since most cooks are already <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/how-tech-has-changed-how-we-cook/261008/" class="text-link">use the internet</a> to support their cooking habits. I began my design process by thinking about the correct technology that could provide a solution for the design challenge. The following table compares different possible technologies based on the strengths they might provide to a cooking assistant product.

				<h1 class="overview-title">Choosing the Correct Form</h1>
				<div class="process-exp">
					I brainstormed Desktop, Mobile Device, Voice Assisant, Wearable applications and a stand alone Electronic Cook Book as possible mediums for a Cooking Assistant app. I ruled out  mediums because of their diffculty of use in the kitchen. For example, a Voice Assistant might provide for voice interaction but may be hard to hear in a noiesy kitchen. Further, mediums that require touch interaction are unusable in situations where hands are unclen. I ultimately selected a wearable solution because a home cook could adapt it to multiple situations. For example, in situations where voice interaction is necessary, a cook can simply speak into their wrist, if voice interaction isn't ideal(e.g. in a busy kitchen) a user can efficently utilize motion gestures and touch interaction.

				<div class="process-exp">
					After selecting the mode of technology, I began structuring my app. I started by  brainstorming concepts that home cooks do when cooking. Next I used the following brainstorm to create a stateflow for the actions cooks carry out when cooking.

				<h1 class="overview-title">Paper Prototype</h1>
					My first step was to build a prototype to show that participants could use to test how effective a wearable can be at supporting the cooking process. To test for the actual act of cooking, I made prop cooking objects(made out of paper), to help simulate the act of cooking.

				<div class="overview">
					After testing my paper prototype through a series of usability studies, I found that the werable as a kitchen assistant concept worked. People easily and intuively followed along with the app to cook a meal. I created additional features for the app using findings from my previous qualtiative research that showed participants activeley search online recipe repositories for the "correct" recipe(s), currate a shopping list and enjoy sharing and storing past recipes they cook. these features were created in a wireframe prototype for testing.

				<h1 class="overview-title">High Fidelity</h1>
				<div class="overview">
					I used wireframes as a tool to talk about my design with cooks and my peers. I showed both groups what I was planning for the app and asked for their feedback. I got feedback on the layout, features and general concept of the app. From that feedback, I utilized my wireframe prototype as a blueprint to make a high fidelity interactable prototype. Again the prototype was adjusted through informal usability tests and show-and-tell sessions.

				<div class="overview">
					Through this experience, I found, that the protyping technology for wearables is lacking. To truly see the effectiveness of this type of app, its necessary to test the same app idea in a real world context. I plan to do this in the future using the same mockup screens used for the high fidelity mockup and making a simple prototype in swift.
