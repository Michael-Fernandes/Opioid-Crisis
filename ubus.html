					Uncertain Bus
				</h1>
				<p class="overview" >
					Even with the help of mobile trip-planning apps, bus riders can struggle to make a decision of when to leave to catch a bus. Trip-planning apps use realtime bus arrival data to provide predictions of when of when a bus is most likely to come but, do not indicate that those predictions are uncertain. Uncertain Bus's interface communicates the concept of uncertainity to lay audiences, allowing people to make better decisions about every day events in their lives.

					My Role
				</h2>
				<p class="overview">
						My role with the Uncertain Bus project lasted ~1.5 years and resulted with a published paper in the confrence of Computer Human Interaction. While working on the project, I took on multiple responsibilities including front-end developer, data analyst, Design researcher and technical writer. The following focuses on how my role as UX designer led to the sucessful testing of 20 different display types.

				Problem and Background
				</h2>
				<p class="process-exp">
					Interpreting predictions made by computers may introduce error into human decision making. A range of past work has shown that displaying uncertaininty can reduce these errors [<a class="text-link" href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/xap-18-1-126.pdf" target="_blank" >ex1</a>, <a class="text-link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-35589-8_45" target="_blank" >ex2</a>, <a class="text-link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-35589-8_45" target="_blank">ex3</a>].
					However, communicating the results of the decision in a way that is suitable for in the moment decisions and usable by a wide audience poses a challenge for designers. Up to this point, it has been unclear whether lay audiences can make decisions based on displays incpoperating uncertainity.
				</p>
				<p class="process-exp">
					Uncertain Bus  expands on past research done on establishing best pracitices for presenting uncertainity information from a machine learning system to bus riders. Using <a class="text-link" href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2016-WhenIsMyBus-CHI.pdf" target="_blank">past research</a> that established feasibility and design criteria for displaying uncertainity in realtime data, my team and I began by brainstorming possible visualizations and representations that we could add to the popular trip planning app OneBusAway.

					Framing Requirements
				</h2>
				<p class="process-exp">
					The intial goal of this project was to provide proof that people can use uncertainity information to make better decisions, specifically around realtime information. To achieve the goal, I set the following design goals:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Mantain the look and feel of current Trip Planning apps(<a class="text-link" href="https://lh1.googleusercontent.com/6uNPkhxwDeLiAFPSs8iZgNtrqFv1nUVN2ueGZyByeXWcy0e39JJSnC4mOrFOmZI4An0=h900">OneBusAway</a> was used as a reference).
					</li>
					<li>
						Mantain a <i>glanacable interface</i> that can be used to make in the moment decisions.  
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="process-exp">
					To further understand the context of the design work I did, please refer to the <a class="text-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4-9LU1LGdnVYlhBVkMya0l1QjQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">paper</a> submitted for peer review at <a class="text-link" href="https://chi2018.acm.org/" target="_blank">CHI 2018</a>. The following focuses on my role and contributions as a UX designer on the project.

				<h2 class="process-title">Thinking Modularly</h2>
				<p class="process-exp">My team and I intially thought we would test 6 displays. I knew from this fact, my design would have to be interchangable for each display tested. Designing with a modular mindset ended up being key to the final result of the project. In the end, we evaluated over <b>20 different variations of displays</b>.</p>

				<p class='process-exp'>For this project, <strong>my design process adapted in an agile way to fit the unique constraints</strong> of designing for a modular system.  I began the design process by focusing on individual components before piecing the components together.

				<p class='process-exp spaced'>Since the basic parameters of the interface we're already set, I began by breaking down the larger interface into smaller components, I knew the final design would include. These pieces became the building blocks that I <b>fit together, like a puzzle, to find the correct layout</b>.

				<h1 class="process-title">Connecting With Bus Riders</h1>
				<p class='proces-exp'>
					In order to mimic the same look, feel and most importantly, the information stored on OneBusAway within the Uncertain Bus interface. The challenge here came with integrating uncertainty displays into the OneBusAway system while maintaining glanceability. I solved this design problem by encoding the information found in OBA directly into the uncertainty visualization itself. Encoding information directly within uncertainty displays created a more cohesive and informationally-rich interface.

				<h1 class="process-title">Motion for Convenience</h1>
				<p class='proces-exp'>
					In previous research, bus riders expressed need of making comparisons between multiple routes. To accommodate for this the interface incorporates a motion design that shifts the each bus timeline to the right, centering each visualization within the interface as it rises to the top. This animation allows bus riders to visually compare routes with relatively similar arrival times. I included this animation based on the previous findings that riders compare the arrival times of buses against each other to figure out what bus works best for them.</p>

				<h1 class="process-title">Somethings Just Don't Translate</h1>
				<p class='proces-exp'>
						During early usability tests, I found some of the information included in OBA did not make sense to people making decisions with UBUS. In particular,  annotations that informed the user on how late or early a bus may arrive compared to its originally scheduled arrival time interfered with decision making. I found late-or-early annotations confused participants as to whether to pay attention to the uncertainty representation or the annotation. Since, in most cases, late annotations don't give an actual indication of the likelihood of a bus coming early or late, we choose to remove the annotations for testing purposes.

				<h1 class="process-title">After Testing</h1>
				<p class='proces-exp'>
					I tested my design throughout the design process with guerilla usability tests(12+ people) and pilot tests of our online experiment (~90 people). After intial tests, 400+ people participated in our <a class="text-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4-9LU1LGdnVYlhBVkMya0l1QjQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">experiment</a>. In short, our experiment  asks participants to make decisions on when to leave for a bus based on a given scenario using a randomily assigned version of our interface as their decision-making tool. We used quantiative metrics(e.g. "point rewards" for catching the bus, time spent on each decision and minutes spent at the bus stop) collected throughout the experiment to determine how participants made decisions based off their assigned interface.
