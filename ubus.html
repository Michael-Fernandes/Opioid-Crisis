					Uncertain Bus
				</h1>
				<p class="overview" >
					Even with the help of mobile trip-planning apps, bus riders can struggle to make a decision of when to leave to catch a bus. Trip-planning apps use realtime bus arrival data to provide predictions of when of when a bus is most likely to come but, do not indicate that those predictions are uncertain. Uncertain Bus's interface communicates the concept of uncertainity to lay audiences, allowing people to make better decisions about every day events in their lives.

					My Role
				</h2>
				<p class="overview">
						My role with the Uncertain Bus project lasted ~1.5 years and resulted with a published paper in the confrence of Computer Human Interaction. While working on the project, I took on multiple responsibilities including front-end developer, data analyst, Design researcher and technical writer. The following focuses on how my role as UX designer led to the sucessful testing of 20 different display types.

				Problem and Background
				</h2>
				<p class="process-exp">
					Interpreting predictions made by computers may introduce error into human decision making. A range of past work has shown that displaying uncertaininty can reduce these errors [<a class="text-link" href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/xap-18-1-126.pdf" target="_blank" >ex1</a>, <a class="text-link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-35589-8_45" target="_blank" >ex2</a>, <a class="text-link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-35589-8_45" target="_blank">ex3</a>].
					However, communicating the results of the decision in a way that is suitable for in the moment decisions and usable by a wide audience poses a challenge for designers. Up to this point, it has been unclear whether lay audiences can make decisions based on displays incpoperating uncertainity.

				<p class="process-exp">
					Uncertain Bus  expands on past research done on establishing best pracitices for presenting uncertainity information from a machine learning system to bus riders. Using <a class="text-link" href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2016-WhenIsMyBus-CHI.pdf" target="_blank">past research</a> that established feasibility and design criteria for displaying uncertainity in realtime data, my team and I began by brainstorming possible visualizations and representations that we could add to the popular trip planning app OneBusAway.

				<div class="process-exp">
					The following scenario illustrates how uncertainity may affect bus riders.</br>
					<ul class="scenario">
					<li>Sara looks at OneBusAway to find her bus is predicted to arrive in 10 minutes. She decides to arrive at the stop in 9 minutes. Two things could happen:</br></li>

					<li><i>A bus could come later</i> &#58; a bus may spend an abnormal time at a red light or a frazzled passenger might struggle to find the last quarter in his back pocket.</li>

					<li><i>A bus could come earlier</i> &#58; a bus may catch consecutive green lights or ridership may  be below normal.</li>
					<li>In both scenarios, events outside of Sara's control affect her decision.

					Choosing An End Destination
				</h2>
				<p class="process-exp">
					The intial goal of this project was to provide proof that people can use uncertainity information to make better decisions, specifically around realtime information. To achieve the goal, I set the following design goals:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Mantain the look and feel of current Trip Planning apps(<a class="text-link" href="https://lh1.googleusercontent.com/6uNPkhxwDeLiAFPSs8iZgNtrqFv1nUVN2ueGZyByeXWcy0e39JJSnC4mOrFOmZI4An0=h900">OneBusAway</a> was used as a reference).
					</li>
					<li>
						Mantain a <i>glanacable interface</i> that can be used to make in the moment decisions.  
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="process-exp">
					To further understand the context of the design work I did, please refer to the <a class="text-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4-9LU1LGdnVYlhBVkMya0l1QjQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">paper</a> submitted for peer review at <a class="text-link" href="https://chi2018.acm.org/" target="_blank">CHI 2018</a>.

				<h2 class="process-title">Thinking Modularly</h2>
				<p class="process-exp">My team and I intially thought we would test 6 displays. From this, I  knew my design would have to be interchangable for each display we tested. Designing with a modular mindset ended up being crucial to the final result of the project, in the end over <b>20 different variations of displays were evaluated</b>. Having an interchangable design layout allowed for all 20 variations to be easily be implemented and tested. </p>

				<p class='process-exp'>For this project, <strong>my design process adapted in an agile way to fit the unique constraints</strong> of designing for a modular system.  I began the design process by focusing on individual components before piecing the components together was key to the eventual success of the interface.

				<p class='process-exp spaced'>Since the basic parameters of the interface we're already set, I began by breaking down the larger interface into the necessary pieces I knew the final design would include. These pieces became the building blocks that I <b>fit together, like a puzzle, to find the correct layout</b>.

				<h1 class="process-title">Connecting With Bus Riders</h1>
				<p class='proces-exp'>
					Uncertain Bus choose to follow the overall design language set by the popular trip planning app OneBusAway. We did this because the open sourced code for OBA would allow later stages of the project to adapt the OBA source code for our interface. To engage the users in a similar way established by OBA, I needed to recreate the look, feel and most importantly, the information stored on OneBusAway within the Uncertain Bus interface. The challenge here came with integrating uncertainty displays into the OneBusAway system while mantaining glancability. I solved this design problem by encoding the information found in OBA directly into the uncertainity visualization it self. Encoding information directly within uncertainity displays created a more cohesive and informationally-rich interface.

				<h1 class="process-title">Motion Design for Convenience</h1>
				<p class='proces-exp'>
					In previous research, bus riders expressed need of making comparisons between multiple routes. To accommodate for this the interface incoperates a motion design that slides the each bus timeline to the right to center a visualization within the interface. This animation allows bus riders to visually compare routes with realitively similar arrival times. The decision to include this animation came from past findings that riders compare the arrival times of buses against each other to figure out what bus works best for them.

				<h1 class="process-title">Somethings Just Don't Translate</h1>
				<p class='proces-exp'>
					During early usability tests, I found some of the information encodings included from OneBusAway did not make sense to people making decision on when to leave for a bus. In particular,  annotations that informed the user on how late or early a bus may arrive compared to its originaly scheduled arrival time interfered with decision making. I found late-or-early annotations confused participants as to whether to pay attention to the uncertainity representation or the annotation. Since, in most cases, late annotations don't give an actual indication of the likelihood of a bus coming earlier or later, the annotation and color correspondance that go along with it was removed from the system. Making for a simpler, more effective interface.

				<p class='proces-exp'>
					I tested my design throughout the design process with guerilla usability tests(12+ people) and pilot tests(~90 people) of our online experiment. After intial tests, 400+ people participated in our <a class="text-link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4-9LU1LGdnVYlhBVkMya0l1QjQ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">experiment</a> which asks participants to make decisions on when to leave for a bus based on a given scenario using a randomily assigned version of our interface as their decision-making tool. We used quantiative metrics("point rewards" for catching the bus and time spent on each decision, minutes spent at bus stop) collected throughout the experiment to determine how participants made decisions based off their assigned interface.

				<p class='proces-exp'>
					This work succeeded in showing how uncertainty displays can effectively aid people in making deicisions around realtime predictions. To take this finding one further, a more ethnographic style of research must be done on our displays in real world use cases. Even though the displays tested in our work may allow for better decision making, it is unclear how people's behavior when using the displays might adapt in the real world. 
				</p>
				<p class='proces-exp'>
					To complete my role with the project, I completed designs based off the data collected from the experiment. I used the finding that Dot Plots allow for the best decision making around realtime transit data to create an interface that spatially accomodates for this particular design.
